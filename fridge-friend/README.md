# Components
Each folder contains all the files associated with each component. FridgeFriendApp houses the AddMeal, ReportArea, and MealList. MealList is comprised of Meals, which in turn houses IngredientForm. 
# Languages
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React
# Improvements
Needs improved styling. It would be nice to use an API so that grocery items are automatically imported and users can select what they need. Amount and measurements would be helpful for consumers too. Lacks the ability to edit items and needs the ability to delete ingredients. Grocery list has rendering issues and does not have the ability to check off what was purchased. In the distant future, would like the ability to track leftover groceries to use that to meal plan in the future.
